What is Namoto?
----------------

Namoto is a lite version of Bitcoin using scrypt as a proof-of-work algorithm.
 - 6.3 minute block targets
 - subsidy halves in 1MM blocks (~12 years)
 - 31 million total coins

The rest is the same as Bitcoin.
 - 16 coins per block
 - 6720 blocks to retarget difficulty

For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of
the Namoto client sofware, see http://www.namoto.org.

Build Linux Namoto-QT from source code:

	**-------Require Clean Unix--------**
	sudo apt-get install make
	wget https://www.openssl.org/source/openssl-1.0.2l.tar.gz
	tar -xzvf openssl-1.0.2l.tar.gz
	cd openssl-1.0.2l 
	sudo ./config
	sudo make install
	**--------------------------------**
	
	cd src
	make -f makefile.unix -Wno-deprecated
	cd ..
	qmake
	make

	./namoto-qt

Development process
-------------------

Developers work in their own trees, then submit pull requests when they think
their feature or bug fix is ready.

If it is a simple/trivial/non-controversial change, then one of the Namoto
development team members simply pulls it.

If it is a *more complicated or potentially controversial* change, then the patch
submitter will be asked to start a discussion with the devs and community.

The patch will be accepted if there is broad consensus that it is a good thing.
Developers should expect to rework and resubmit patches if the code doesn't
match the project's coding conventions (see `doc/coding.txt`) or are
controversial.

The `master` branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be
completely stable. [Tags](https://github.com/namotod/namoto/tags) are created
regularly to indicate new official, stable release versions of Namoto.

Testing
-------

Testing and code review is the bottleneck for development; we get more pull
requests than we can review and test. Please be patient and help out, and
remember this is a security-critical project where any mistake might cost people
lots of money.

### Automated Testing

Developers are strongly encouraged to write unit tests for new code, and to
submit new unit tests for old code.

Unit tests for the core code are in `src/test/`. To compile and run them:

    cd src
	make -f makefile.unix test -Wno-deprecated

Unit tests for the GUI code are in `src/qt/test/`. To compile and run them:

    qmake BITCOIN_QT_TEST=1 -o Makefile.test bitcoin-qt.pro
    make -f Makefile.test
    ./namoto-qt_test
